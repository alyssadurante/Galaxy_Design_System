## Overview

Empty states are a simple yet extremely powerful way to keep a user informed, supported, and on a productive path. They provide opportunities to communicate what the user would see if they had data, while providing constructive guidance about next steps.

With just enough contextual guidance, empty states ensure a smoothness of experience, especially when things aren’t working as expected.

Most people are familiar with the basic empty state page that explains what data would normally appear on a page. However, it’s not always a one size fits all.

This pattern explores the following approaches:

Basic empty states for first use, user action confirmation, and error management
In-depth supplements and alternatives for first use empty states, including in-line documentation, onboarding, and starter content
