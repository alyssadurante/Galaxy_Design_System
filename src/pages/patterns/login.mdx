## Overview

Login is often the first interaction a user has with your product. This entry point experience is an important moment in establishing your productâ€™s brand and experience and sets the tone for their overall experience with the product.

### When to use

The login page is presented to users in the following scenarios:

- When a user wants to gain access to an app.
- When a user has logged out voluntarily. They will see a confirmation message after which they will be automatically redirected back to the login page.
- When a user has been logged out due to inactivity. In this scenario, when the user logs back in they should be redirected to the last page they were on, before being logged out.
