## Overview

Use badges to label, categorize, or organize items using keywords that describe them.

### When to use:

- As a method of filtering data, to show only items within that particular category.
- When content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
- As indicators of growth, i.e. increase/decrease in metrics.

1. **Simple**: This is a simple badge with the ```rounded-full``` class. This is the default badge shape.
2. **Indicator Badge**: Indicator badges are used to show increases/decreases. Mostly used in metrics. 
3. **Simple with Close Button**: This should describe the issue and any action the user needs to take, if any. The message will grow along with the length of the description but should be as succinct as possible.
3. **Actions (optional)**: One or more links that enable the user to act on the section message content.
