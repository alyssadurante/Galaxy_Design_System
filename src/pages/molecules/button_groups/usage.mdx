## Overview

A button group gives users access to frequently performed, related actions. Use button groups when there is a close relationship between a number of buttons.

Common placements of grouped buttons can be found in Jira issues or while editing Confluence pages. This pattern is normally used at the top of the page.

### When to use:

- Group buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance.
