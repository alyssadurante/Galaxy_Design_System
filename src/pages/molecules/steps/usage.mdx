## Overview

Use steps to keep the user on track when completing a specific task. By dividing the end goal into smaller, sub-tasks, it helps clearly guide the user to complete their task.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

1. **Current step**: Shows the current step that the user is on.
2. **Unvisited**: Shows steps that user has not visited. The step and label are more subtle to indicate this.
