1. **Label**: Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is left-aligned above the input area.
2. **Date Input Field**: Selecting this field opens the calendar component. Users can also input dates into the field. Once a date is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example shows date formatted in ‘dd/mm/yyyy’ but this can be customized.
3. **Calendar**: Contains the list of all dates. Selecting the previous or next arrows moves the calendar through months. The selected date area is highlighted by a different color fill.

## Variants

#### Single Date Picker

In a single date picker a user has the option to either manually input a date in the text field or select one specific date from the menu calendar. It requires a day, month, and year to be selected.

</Column>
</Row>

#### Date Range Picker

The date range picker functions much like the single date picker but instead of choosing just one date the user can choose a start and end date. For each date in the range, users have the option to manually enter the date in a text field or select the date in the calendar. Each point requires a day, month, and year to be selected.
