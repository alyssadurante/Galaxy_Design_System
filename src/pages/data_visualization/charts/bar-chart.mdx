## Bar charts

A bar chart is a chart that visualizes data as a set of rectangular bars, their lengths being proportional to the values they represent. The horizontal axis shows the values, and the vertical axis shows the categories they belong to. So, the bar chart is a vertical version of the column chart. In multiple-series bar charts, values are grouped by categories.
