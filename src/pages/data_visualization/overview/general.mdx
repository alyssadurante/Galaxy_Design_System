### Title

A title describes what the graph is about and is set in title case capitalization. It may state the type of quantitative and categorical relationship the data presents.

### Axis labels

An axis label describes the quantitative or categorical value of an axis. For a quantitative label, make sure to include the unit, either in the label name or in parentheses after it. 

### Grid lines

Grid lines are points of reference aligned to data increments that divide the area of a graph into smaller regions, enhancing the ability to notice subtle differences that makes comparing data easier. Grid lines are not required on a graph and can be toggled on as a filter option.

### Tooltips

A tooltip appears when hovering over content in a graph, showing the exact value(s) for that point of intersection of the x and y-axes.

### Empty states

Empty states appear when no data is available, which may be due to a number of reasons. When applicable, include a call to action that helps users to get the graph up and running.
